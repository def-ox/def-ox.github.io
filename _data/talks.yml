      title: "Market Making in NFTs"
      abstract: "This study discusses a framework for market making in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) which represent unique digital assets in a low liquidity and high price volatility environment. The market making problem differs from fungible cryptocurrencies as there is no layered orderbook structure of market depth and market makers would need to hold inventory on the other side of the trades for a non-negligible horizon. We have developed a model for prices in market making context in terms of embedded optionality of trading an NFT at either the floor or a price that is closer to the appraisal value. In order to develop the model for optionality of trading an NFT, we have defined a model on the joint price dynamics of the NFT and its corresponding floor. The price dynamics were decomposed into an intrinsic price diffusion process and jump components relating to liquidity events. Besides NFTs, the approach presented in this paper could provide insights for market making in other ”non- fungible” asset classes such as art or housing. "

      title: "The Information Content of Blockchain Fees"
      abstract: "Trading at decentralized exchanges (DEXs) requires traders to bid blockchain fees to determine the execution priority of their orders. We employ a structural vector-autoregressive (structural VAR) model to provide evidence that DEX trades with high fees not only reveal more private information, but also respond more to public price innovations on centralized exchanges (CEXs), contributing to price discovery. Using a unique dataset of Ethereum mempool orders, we further demonstrate that high fees do not result from traders competing with each other on private or public information. Rather, our analysis lends support to the hypothesis that they bid high fees to reduce the execution risk of their orders due to blockchain congestion."

      title: "Decentralised Finance and Automated Market Making: Execution and Speculation"
      abstract: "Automated market makers (AMMs) are a new prototype of trading venues which are revolutionising the way market participants interact. At present, the majority of AMMs are constant function market makers (CFMMs) where a deterministic trading function determines how markets are cleared. A distinctive characteristic of CFMMs is that execution costs are given by a closed-form function of price, liquidity, and transaction size. This gives rise to a new class of trading problems. We focus on constant product market makers and show how to optimally trade a large position in an asset and how to execute statistical arbitrages based on market signals. We employ stochastic optimal control tools to devise two strategies. One strategy is based on the dynamics of prices in competing venues and assumes constant liquidity in the AMM. The other strategy assumes that AMM prices are efficient and liquidity is stochastic. We use Uniswap v3 data to study price, liquidity, and trading cost dynamics, and to motivate the models. Finally, we perform consecutive runs of in-sample estimation of model parameters and out-of-sample liquidation and arbitrage strategies to showcase the performance of the strategies. "

      title: "Liquidity Providers in Automated Market Makers: a Mean-Variance Analysis of Payoffs"
      abstract: "We analyze the performance of Liquidity Providers (LPs) providing liquidity to different types of Automated Market Makers (AMMs). This analysis is carried out using a mean / standard deviation viewpoint à la Markowitz, though based on the PnL of LPs compared to that of agents holding coins outside of AMMs. We show that LPs tend to perform poorly in a wide variety of CFMMs under realistic market conditions. We then explore an alternative AMM design in which an oracle feeds the current market exchange rate to the AMM which then quotes a bid/ask spread. This allows us to define an efficient frontier for the performance of LPs in an idealized world with perfect information and to show that the smart use of oracles greatly improves LPs' risk / return profile, even in the case of a lagged oracle.

      title: "Mining Pool and Centralization in Proof-of-Work Equipped Blockchain"
      abstract: "Mining in isolation is no longer possible in popular Proof-of-Work blockchains these days. Miners join mining pools to mitigate the financial risk induced by mining activity. The presentation focuses on mining pools that apply the Pay-per-Share reward system. A value function based on the surplus of miners and pool managers is defined to better understand the agent's decision whether or not to join a mining pool. Will these interactions between miners and pool managers result in a balanced situation in terms of distribution of computing power between mining pools?"

      title: "Differential Liquidity Provision in Uniswap V3 and Implications for Contract Design"
      abstract: "Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) facilitate trading assets on-chain without the need of a trusted third party. Amongst these, constant function market maker DEXs such as Uniswap handle the most volume of trades between ERC-20 tokens. In Uniswap v3, liquidity providers (LPs) are given the option to differentially allocate liquidity to be used for trades that occur within specific price intervals. We formalize the profit and loss that LPs can earn in simplified trade dynamics and are able to compute optimal liquidity allocations for liquidity providers who hold fixed price trajectory beliefs. We use this tool to shed light on the design question regarding how v3 contracts should partition price space for permissible liquidity allocations. Our results suggest that a richer space of potential partitions can simultaneously benefit both LPs and traders."

He holds a PhD (2022) and a MA (2018) in Computer Science from Princeton University and a BS in Computer Engineering (2016) from the Federal University of Itajubá. His primary research interests are in market design, algorithmic economics, cryptography, and information security. He is particularly interested in how one can build trust by building platforms that have the incentive to follow their own specification. For example, auctions are the main building block of how we transact on eBay or how Google sells advertising; however, it is impossible to know whether or not a self-interested auctioneer is also shill bidding, i.e., bidding in their auction with a fake identity. His research shows this kind of manipulation is not inevitable, and one can design auctions that are credible by design."

      title: "Cryptocurrencies, Mining & Mean Field Games"
      abstract: "We present a mean field game model to study the question of how centralization of reward and computational power occur in Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies. Miners compete against each other for mining rewards by increasing their computational power. This leads to a novel mean field game of jump intensity control, which we solve explicitly for miners maximizing exponential utility, and handle numerically in the case of miners with power utilities. We show that the heterogeneity of their initial wealth distribution leads to greater imbalance of the reward distribution, or a ``rich get richer'' effect. This concentration phenomenon is aggravated by a higher bitcoin mining reward, and reduced by competition. Additionally, an advantaged miner with cost advantages such as access to cheaper electricity, contributes a significant amount of computational power in equilibrium, unaffected by competition from less efficient miners. Hence, cost efficiency can also result in the type of centralization seen among miners of cryptocurrencies."

      title: "Decentralised Finance and Automated Market Making: Predictable Loss and Optimal Liquidity Provision"
      abstract: "We introduce a new comprehensive metric of predictable loss (PL) for liquidity providers in constant function automated market makers and derive an optimal liquidity provision strategy. PL compares the value of the LP's holdings in the liquidity pool (assuming no fee revenue) with that of a self-financing portfolio that replicates the LP's holdings and invests in a risk-free account. We provide closed-form formulae for PL, and show that the losses stem from two sources: the convexity cost, which depends on liquidity taking activity and the convexity of the pool's trading function; the opportunity cost, which is due to locking the LP's assets in the pool. For LPs in constant product market makers with concentrated liquidity, we derive a closed-form strategy that dynamically adjusts the range around the exchange rate as a function of market trend, volatility, and liquidity taking activity in the pool. We prove that the profitability of liquidity provision depends on the tradeoff between PL and fee income. Finally, we use Uniswap v3 data to show that LPs have traded at a significant loss, and to show that the out-of-sample performance of our strategy is considerably superior to the historical performance of LPs in the pool we consider.
